## A Potato's Tale

In gardens deep where earth runs brown,
The humble spud sleeps safe and sound.
With eyes that sprout and skin so rough,
This tuber's made of sturdy stuff.

From fries so crisp to mash so smooth,
The potato's got that perfect groove.
Whether baked or boiled with care,
No meal's complete without this fare.

Oh noble root, so versatile,
You make us pause and stop and smile.
In every form, you bring us joy,
From tot to chip, you're nature's toy.
